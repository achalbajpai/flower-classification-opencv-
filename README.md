# flower-classification-opencv-
This project uses the OpenVINO toolkit to perform flower classification based on a pre-trained neural network model. The model is loaded, compiled, and then applied to an input image to predict the flower type. The project specifically uses the OpenVINO Python API along with OpenCV for image processing.
